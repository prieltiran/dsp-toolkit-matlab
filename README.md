# DSP Toolkit (MATLAB)

A small MATLAB mini-toolkit that demonstrates common DSP operations:
FFT spectrum analysis and simple low-pass filtering on noisy signals.

## Features
- Generate a clean sine signal + additive noise
- Compute and plot FFT magnitude spectrum
- Apply a simple low-pass filter (moving average)
- Compare signals in time-domain and frequency-domain

## How to run
Open MATLAB, set the repo folder as your current folder, then run:
```matlab
main_demo
